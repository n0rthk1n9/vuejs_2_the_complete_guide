# VueJS 2 - The Complete Guide

Here I constantly share my learning process in vue.js with you. I use the awesome course from Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller from udemy.com, definately check this course out if you really want to learn vue.js: [Vue JS 2 - The Complete Guide (incl. Vue Router & Vuex)](https://www.udemy.com/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/)

## Getting Started

To start digging through my code just clone this repository copieing the ssh-Link on your machine with

```
git clone 'link_goes_here'
```

### Installing

Everything form module 1 - module 5 can just be executed by clicking the index.html File in the subfolders

Everything from module 6 requires additional setup:

Go to the "1_course_content" or "2_exercise" directory and execute

```
npm install
```

This should automaticly install all dependencies needed to run the project. I used node.js 7.4.0.
After that you can run the project just by

```
npm run dev
```
